# Philosophers

## Introduction

The **Philosophers** project is part of the 42 curriculum and is designed to introduce students to **concurrent programming**, **threads**, and **mutexes**. The project is based on the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem**, where multiple philosophers sit around a table, alternating between eating, thinking, and sleeping while avoiding **deadlocks** and **race conditions**.

## Objectives

- Understand and implement **multithreading**.
- Learn to use **mutexes** to prevent data races.
- Manage synchronization to avoid **deadlocks** and **starvation**.
- Work within **strict time constraints** to handle execution timing properly.

## The Problem

There are **N philosophers** sitting around a table. Each philosopher follows this cycle:

1. **Think**
2. **Take two forks** (one at a time, shared with their neighbors)
3. **Eat**
4. **Put down both forks**
5. **Sleep**

Each philosopher needs **two forks** to eat, but each fork is shared between two neighboring philosophers, leading to potential **deadlocks** if not handled correctly.

## Rules & Constraints

- A philosopher can **only take forks that are available** (not being used by another philosopher).
- A philosopher **must eat within a specific time** before they starve.
- The program must be designed to **avoid deadlocks and starvation**.

## Implementation Details

- The program is written in **C**.
- Uses **threads** to simulate philosophers.
- **Mutexes** ensure safe access to shared resources (forks).
- The program must handle **timing constraints accurately**.

## Compilation & Execution

### Compilation

```bash
make
```

This generates an executable called `philo`.

### Usage

```bash
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

#### Arguments:

1. **number\_of\_philosophers**: Total number of philosophers.
2. **time\_to\_die** (ms): Time a philosopher can stay without eating before they die.
3. **time\_to\_eat** (ms): Time a philosopher takes to eat.
4. **time\_to\_sleep** (ms): Time a philosopher spends sleeping before thinking again.
5. **[Optional] number\_of\_times\_each\_philosopher\_must\_eat**: If provided, the program stops when all philosophers have eaten this many times.

### Example

```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
```

This runs the simulation with 5 philosophers where:

- They die if they donâ€™t eat within **800ms**.
- Eating takes **200ms**.
- Sleeping takes **200ms**.

## Key Features

- **Multithreading**: Each philosopher is represented as a separate thread.
- **Mutex synchronization**: Used to prevent race conditions when accessing forks.
- **Precise timing**: Ensures accurate delays for eating, thinking, and sleeping.
- **Deadlock prevention**: Implements strategies to prevent deadlocks, such as ordering fork pickup.

## Possible Enhancements

- Implement a **version using semaphores**.
- Optimize for **better performance with larger numbers of philosophers**.
- Improve timing accuracy with **better thread scheduling**.
